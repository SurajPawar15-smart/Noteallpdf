	<h1> What is Do While Loop?</h1>
	<p>In the previous Lecture You learned while loop in Javascript. A do while loop is similar to while loop with one exception that it executes the statements inside the body of do-while before checking the condition. On the other hand in the while loop, first the condition is checked and then the statements in while loop are executed. So you can say that if a condition is false at the first place then the do while would run once, however the while loop would not run at all.</p>
	<p>
	If you recall the way the for and while loops work, you will remember that these loop types check for the loop condition at the beginning of the loop. Unless the condition is satisfied the loop will not be executed.
<br><br>
The do while loop checks the condition at the end of the loop. This means that the statements inside the loop body will be executed at least once even if the condition is never true.

Loops are one of the most useful features of programming languages, and in this lecture  we will learn about the while and do...while loops in JavaScript.
</b><br><br>The while and do...while statements in JavaScript are similar to conditional statements, which are blocks of code that will execute if a specified condition results in true. Unlike an if statement, which only evaluates once, a loop will run multiple times until the condition no longer evaluates to true.

	<p>As you can see, the do portion of the loop comes first, and is followed by while (condition). The code block will run, then the condition will be tested as it is in a normal while loop.
